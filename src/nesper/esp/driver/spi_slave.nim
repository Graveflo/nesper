##  @brief Queue a SPI transaction for execution
##
##  Queues a SPI transaction to be executed by this slave device. (The transaction queue size was specified when the slave
##  device was initialised via spi_slave_initialize.) This function may block if the queue is full (depending on the
##  ticks_to_wait parameter). No SPI operation is directly initiated by this function, the next queued transaction
##  will happen when the master initiates a SPI transaction by pulling down CS and sending out clock signals.
##
##  This function hands over ownership of the buffers in ``trans_desc`` to the SPI slave driver; the application is
##  not to access this memory until ``spi_slave_queue_trans`` is called to hand ownership back to the application.

##  @brief Get the result of a SPI transaction queued earlier
##
##  This routine will wait until a transaction to the given device (queued earlier with
##  spi_slave_queue_trans) has succesfully completed. It will then return the description of the
##  completed transaction so software can inspect the result and e.g. free the memory or
