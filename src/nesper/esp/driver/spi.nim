  #** There are timing issue when reading at high frequency (the frequency is related to whether iomux pins are used, valid time after slave sees the clock).
  # *     - In half-duplex mode, the driver automatically inserts dummy bits before reading phase to fix the timing issue. Set this flag to disable this feature.
  # *     - In full-duplex mode, however, the hardware cannot use dummy bits, so there is no way to prevent data being read from getting corrupted.
  # *       Set this flag to confirm that you're going to work with output only, or read without dummy bits at your own risk.

##  @brief This is a configuration structure for a SPI bus.
##
##  You can use this structure to specify the GPIO pins of the bus. Normally, the driver will use the
##  GPIO matrix to route the signals. An exception is made when all signals either can be routed through
##  the IO_MUX or are -1. In that case, the IO_MUX is used, allowing for >40MHz speeds.
##
##  @note Be advised that the slave driver does not use the quadwp/quadhd lines and fields in spi_bus_config_t refering to these lines will be ignored and can thus safely be left uninitialized.
