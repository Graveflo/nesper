## \* @brief Is flash encryption currently enabled in hardware?
##
##  Flash encryption is enabled if the FLASH_CRYPT_CNT efuse has an odd number of bits set.
##
##  @return true if flash encryption is enabled.
##

proc esp_flash_encryption_enabled*(): bool {.
    importc: "esp_flash_encryption_enabled", header: "esp_flash_encrypt.h".}
##  @brief Update on-device flash encryption
##
##  Intended to be called as part of the bootloader process if flash
##  encryption is enabled in device menuconfig.
##
##  If FLASH_CRYPT_CNT efuse parity is 1 (ie odd number of bits set),
##  then return ESP_OK immediately (indicating flash encryption is enabled
##  and functional).
##
##  If FLASH_CRYPT_CNT efuse parity is 0 (ie even number of bits set),
##  assume the flash has just been written with plaintext that needs encrypting.
##
##  The following regions of flash are encrypted in place:
##
##  - The bootloader image, if a valid plaintext image is found.[*]
##  - The partition table, if a valid plaintext table is found.
##  - Any app partition that contains a valid plaintext app image.
##  - Any other partitions with the "encrypt" flag set. [**]
##
##  After the re-encryption process completes, a '1' bit is added to the
##  FLASH_CRYPT_CNT value (setting the parity to 1) and the EFUSE is re-burned.
##
##  [*] If reflashing bootloader with secure boot enabled, pre-encrypt
##  the bootloader before writing it to flash or secure boot will fail.
##
##  [**] For this reason, if serial re-flashing a previous flashed
##  device with secure boot enabled and using FLASH_CRYPT_CNT to
##  trigger re-encryption, you must simultaneously re-flash plaintext
##  content to all partitions with the "encrypt" flag set or this
##  data will be corrupted (encrypted twice).
##
##  @note The post-condition of this function is that all
##  partitions that should be encrypted are encrypted.
##
##  @note Take care not to power off the device while this function
##  is running, or the partition currently being encrypted will be lost.
##
##  @note RTC_WDT will reset while encryption operations will be performed (if RTC_WDT is configured).
##
##  @return ESP_OK if all operations succeeded, ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE
##  if a fatal error occured during encryption of all partitions.
##

## \* @brief Encrypt-in-place a block of flash sectors
##
##  @note This function resets RTC_WDT between operations with sectors.
##  @param src_addr Source offset in flash. Should be multiple of 4096 bytes.
##  @param data_length Length of data to encrypt in bytes. Will be rounded up to next multiple of 4096 bytes.
##
##  @return ESP_OK if all operations succeeded, ESP_ERR_FLASH_OP_FAIL
##  if SPI flash fails, ESP_ERR_FLASH_OP_TIMEOUT if flash times out.

## \* @brief Write protect FLASH_CRYPT_CNT

##  Intended to be called as a part of boot process if flash encryption
##  is enabled but secure boot is not used. This should protect against
##  serial re-flashing of an unauthorised code in absence of secure boot.

##  The API is called during boot process but can also be called by
##  application to check the current flash encryption mode of ESP32

## \* @brief Check the flash encryption mode during startup
##
##  @note This function is called automatically during app startup,
##  it doesn't need to be called from the app.
##
##  Verifies the flash encryption config during startup:
##
##  - Correct any insecure flash encryption settings if hardware
##    Secure Boot is enabled.
##  - Log warnings if the efuse config doesn't match the project
##   config in any way
